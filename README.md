# hello-world
Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.

## repository
It is used to organize a single project, which can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets , anything you project needs. 

## branch

It is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

master branch by default. we always use branch to experiment and make edits before commiting them to master branch. 

usually create a branch off the master branch, you are actually making a copy,or snapshot of master as it was at that point in time. 

## commit
Saved changs are called commits. each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. 

## pull request

pull requests show diffs of content from both branches. tha changes , additions and subtractions are shown in green and red.
